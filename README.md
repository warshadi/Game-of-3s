# Game of 3s

We want to play a "Game of 3s". Here's how you play it:

First, you pick a random number. Then, repeatedly do the following:

If the number is divisible by 3, divide it by 3.
If it's not, either add 1 or subtract 1 (to make it divisible by 3), then divide it by 3.
The game stops when you reach "1".
